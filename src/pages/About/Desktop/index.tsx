                Full-stack web developer with a background in quality assurance
                and production engineering. My background has provided me with
                high-quality coding skills and a natural understanding of
                software development cycles.
              </p>
              <p>
                My thorough enjoyment of working on backend technologies has
                given me the ability to quickly read and understand existing
                code and systems.
              </p>
              <p>
                Iâ€™d love to leverage my knowledge gained thus far and continue
                to rapidly grow in tech and work collaboratively in a team to
                deliver excellent results.
